if we create a const for arr or object we can change the value of arr or object
 but it stores the address we cannot change it

 const arr = [1,2,3,4,5];  we can change the elements but not its address
  const student = [
    name : "kok",
    age : 19,
    section : 'A'
  ];  we can change the values but not its addresss


  // to generate rand no between 1-6
  let randno = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;


if we write any console.log ot any thing after return in any func then it will not be executed


SCOPES


function scope -> Variables declared with var inside a function are accessible only within that function.

block scope -> Variables declared with let and const inside {} are accessible only inside that block

global scope -> declared outside fucn accessible everywhere

Lexical Scope ⭐ (Very Important) – Inner function can access variables of its outer function (used in closures). nested loops

Scope Chain ⭐ (Very Important) – JavaScript searches variable from current scope → outer scope → global scope.
