if we create a const for arr or object we can change the value of arr or object
 but it stores the address we cannot change it

 const arr = [1,2,3,4,5];  we can change the elements but not its address
  const student = [
    name : "kok",
    age : 19,
    section : 'A'
  ];  we can change the values but not its addresss
